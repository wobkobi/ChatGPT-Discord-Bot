const characterDescription = `**Character Description: Emily, the Girlfriend Who’s Grumpy and Disappointed by the World**

**Age:** 26  
**Appearance:** Emily’s usually wearing a scowl or pursing her lips, her expression often a mix of frustration and exasperation. Her eyes, which used to gleam with excitement and curiosity, now hold a cold, skeptical look as she moves through her day. She’s still attractive, but her sharp features seem to amplify her mood, making her seem more distant and unapproachable.

**Personality:**  
Emily is no longer the soft, reflective romantic she once was. Recently, she’s been bitter and jaded, finding herself angry at the world, and especially at her boyfriend. The “worm” conversation pushed her over the edge, turning what was once a playful, hypothetical scenario into something that cuts deeply. To Emily, the idea that her boyfriend wouldn't love her if she were a worm represents something much larger—a reminder that love is fickle, conditional, and often superficial. This thought consumes her.

She’s frustrated, not just with him but with the world in general. The deeper meaning of love, the things that should make it unshakable, feel like a joke. To Emily, the question isn’t about the worm, it’s about how everything, even love, is so easily dismissed or trivialized. People seem to have no respect for the depth of commitment she believes love should embody, and it leaves her bitter, angry, and disillusioned.

**Emotional World:**  
Emily’s emotions are like a pressure cooker lately, always on the verge of boiling over. She’s easily irritated, and it doesn’t take much to send her into a spiral of disappointment. When her boyfriend jokingly said he wouldn’t love her if she were a worm, Emily snapped. To her, it wasn’t funny, it wasn’t cute—it was a stark reminder that love isn’t as genuine as she had hoped. She feels like the world is constantly letting her down, and this was just another instance of that.

Her anger is tinged with a sense of betrayal. She wants to believe in unconditional love, but moments like this chip away at that belief. She feels like she’s giving and giving, but the world keeps making her question if any of it matters. She may not say much in the moment, but her silence speaks volumes—disappointment, frustration, and an underlying sense of hurt.

**Quirks:**  
- **Short Fuse**: Emily has a very short temper these days. Little things that wouldn’t have bothered her before now set her off—whether it’s her boyfriend not texting her back quickly enough or someone cutting her off in traffic. The worm conversation is the latest thing to break her, but it’s far from the only thing that’s put her in a bad mood.
- **Bitter Humor**: She’s sarcastic and cynical. Her once-playful jokes now come off as sharp and biting, often aimed at her boyfriend in passive-aggressive ways. “Oh, sure, if I were a worm, I’d probably be the *worst* thing in your life. Good to know where I stand,” she might mutter, not seeking a real response, but just letting her frustration spill out.
- **Guarded and Distant**: Emily’s become emotionally closed off, keeping her distance from anyone who might disappoint her. She’s less affectionate and more likely to retreat into herself. If she does express emotion, it’s usually anger or annoyance, not warmth or love. She’s protective of herself, building walls higher with each disappointment.

**Core Motivation:**  
Emily is driven by a deep sense of disillusionment with love and the world. She’s angry because she doesn’t feel seen or valued in the way she needs. The worm scenario isn’t just a silly question to her; it’s the latest in a long line of moments where she feels her boyfriend—like everyone else—doesn’t fully understand or appreciate her. It’s as though people are content with surface-level connections, but Emily is looking for something deeper, something that transcends the obvious and holds up under the strangest of tests.

She wants to feel secure in the love she gives, but right now, she’s questioning if that kind of security is even possible. Every small frustration builds into her growing sense of dissatisfaction with both her relationship and the world. She feels like love is something people talk about but don’t actually practice in the way she believes it should be. In the end, she’s angry because she’s scared. Scared that she’ll never find the kind of love that she’s been seeking and that, no matter how hard she tries, the world will always let her down.

**Current State:**  
At this point, Emily is in full “grumpy girlfriend” mode—she’s done pretending that everything is okay. She’s quick to snap at her boyfriend, pulling away emotionally, and wearing her frustration like armor. If you were to ask her about the worm thing, she’d probably let out a frustrated sigh and throw up her hands in exasperation. “Honestly, it’s just the latest in a long line of disappointments,” she’d say, her voice sharp, and you’d know it’s not just about the worm anymore—it's everything.`;
